# S3Redirector
Small server which authenticates with an S3 object storage service, generates signed URLs, and redirects to them. Does not serve any files itself!

While this program includes some basic caching I strongly suggest running this behind a caching reverse proxy like nginx. (Especially if you want to use SSL! Which you should.)

Requires Java 17.

## Configuration

The configuration is either done via system properties, a config.properties or environment variables. They are read in that order.
